AMCAT known as Aspiring Minds Computer Adaptive Test is an AI-based computer adaptive test which evaluates job applicants on critical areas like communication skills, logical reasoning, quantitative skills, and job-specific domain skills thereby helping recruiters identify the suitability of a candidate for different job roles.

A study carried out on students with engineering disciplines by Aspiring Minds from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) showed the employment outcomes of engineering graduates along with the standardized scores from three different areas - cognitive skills, technical skills and personality skills. The study also recorded the demographic features for each candidate.

With this study, the AMCAT team were able to gather concrete data with which they hoped to understand what has become of candidates since they took part in the tests.They also have highlighted some areas or questions of interest they would like to have answers to. As a data scientist on the AMCAT team, my task is to perform an comprehensive analysis, leaving no stones unturned.

Following the study conducted in 2015 the AMCAT team were able to gather concrete data with which they hoped to understand what has become of candidates since they took part in the tests and find interesting patterns from the study.

This analysis breaks down the objectives into two:
Univariate and Bivariate analysis of variables
Answers and conclusions to relevant hypothesis or questions.
